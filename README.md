# What is this project?
1. An excuse to learn webpack and hosting.
2. A quick way to look up monster stats/rewards for MHW.

# Using MHW Field Guide
* Search for monsters by name, or search for parts sources. Search is case insensitive and goes by partial matches (nice if you can't remember how to spell Jyuratodus!).
* Add new monsters, edit existing ones, or delete monsters from the edit page (not available in heroku live version).
* Check out some neat graphs made with recharts: https://github.com/recharts/recharts
* Click monster names to go to monster detail pages with all the info from in-game

# Live App's Updates
* 03/30/18 - Deviljho added with complete info.
* 04/09/18 - Monster detail pages! Click a monster name to see the monsters weakness spots and breakable parts with drop tables.
* Filled out more info from my researched monsters.
* Added charts page to the live version.
